	<p>Taekwindow is a simple, lightweight and free program that allows you to manipulate floating windows in Microsoft Windows in a way similar to many X11 window managers. It allows you to do the following:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>move windows by grabbing them <em>anywhere</em> (not just the title bar) while holding the Alt key, and then dragging with the left mouse button;</li>
		<li>resize windows by grabbing them <em>anywhere</em> (not just the tiny little border) while holding the Alt key, and then dragging with the right mouse button.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Especially when you have a large screen, you're moving your mouse much more than you ought to. Taekwindow can save you time, frustration and RSI!</p>
	<p>The program is released under the BSD licence, which means that it is free as in speech as well as in beer. <strong><a href="download.html">Download it now!</a></strong></p>
