Taekwindow
==========

Taekwindow is a simple, lightweight and free program that allows you to
manipulate floating windows in Microsoft Windows in a way similar to
many X11 window managers.

Installation
------------

Simply extract the archive to any place you like. Make sure that the
files taekwindow.exe and taekwindowhooks.dll are in the same directory.

If you want to load the program when you log on to Windows, add a
shortcut to taekwindow.exe in the Startup folder in your Start Menu.

Using the program
-----------------

Start taekwindow.exe to load the program. Nothing will seem to happen,
but you can now do the following:
- Hold Alt and drag a window with the left mouse button to move it.
- Hold Alt and drag a window with the right mouse button to resize it.

To stop the program, just run taekwindow.exe again. It will not load
itself, but rather stop the running instance and then quit. You can also
stop it through the Task Manager if you prefer.
