TODO
----

- Test release build thoroughly on XP and Windows 7.
- Release.

- Make wrapper classes for the mouse/keyboard hooks.
- Try disabling Unicode for smaller EXE.
- Make the tray icon menu into a resource.
- Look into the icon: it's 15 kB, and seems to be uncompressed in the .exe. (Aren't we using PNG?)
- Strip the metadata from PNGs -- there are references to Inkscape and ImageReady.
- Search for TODO and do them.
- Do a full code review.
