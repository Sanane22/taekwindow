    Start <code>taekwindow.exe</code> to load the program. A new icon will appear in the taskbar notification area
    (next to the clock, also known as the system tray). You can now do the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hold left Alt and drag a window with the left mouse button to move it. If you have multiple monitors, you can also move maximized windows between monitors in this way.</li>
    <li>Hold left Alt and drag a window with the right mouse button to resize it. If you resize a maximized window, it will automatically be unmaximized.</li>
    <li>Middle-click on the title bar of a window to push it to the background.</li>
    <li>Use the scroll wheel on the window under the mouse cursor, instead of the window that happens to have the focus.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The icon in the taskbar can be used in the following ways:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Left-click the icon to completely disable all features of Taekwindow. Use this in case some
      application needs to handle the events that Taekwindow is catching, but you don't want to quit
      Taekwindow completely. The icon will turn gray to indicate that it is disabled;
      left-click again to re-enable.
    </li>
    <li>
      Double-click the icon to open the Preferences dialog.
    </li>
    <li>
      Right-click the icon to show a menu, through which you can enable/disable the program,
      open the Preferences dialog, and exit Taekwindow completely.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You can exit the program via the taskbar icon. If the icon is invisible, you can either
    use the button in the Preferences dialog to exit, or simply end the process through
    Windows Task Manager.
