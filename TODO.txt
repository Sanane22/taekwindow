- Fix icon to look nice on Windows 7 taskbar; provide 20x20 and 24x24 icons for the tray.
- Rename "Configuration" to "Preferences" to blend in better with Windows conventions.
- Update the Readme.
- Important: we are storing classes with virtual functions in the DLL's shared data segment. This is evil and shouldn't even work! Rethink this.
- Add some way to get to the configuration dialog if the tray icon is hidden.
