- Eliminate dependency on CRT: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1495173/producing-small-windows-binaries/1499517#1499517
- Make it build with and without UNICODE by replacing L"" by _T(""); remove needless L"" items from version.h.
- Set warning level to maximum and treat warnings as errors.
- Fix icon to look nice on Windows 7 taskbar; provide 20x20 and 24x24 icons for the tray.
- See what changes from the MFC branch need to be backported to trunk. There are at least useful changes to information.xml.
- Rename "Configuration" to "Preferences" to blend in better with Windows conventions.
- Update the Readme.
- Important: we are storing classes with virtual functions in the DLL's shared data segment. This is evil and shouldn't even work! Rethink this.
- Remove C# configuration dialog and references to it in information.xml.
