TODO
----

- Update the Readme.
- Do a full code review.
- Add some way to get to the configuration dialog if the tray icon is hidden.
- Try a modal loop for move/resize events. Much easier to maintain, and hopefully more reliable too.
- Load cursors once, and unload them at exit.
- Fix the cursor (by capturing the mouse?).
- Make the "ignore" state not move the mouse cursor.
- Search for TODO and do them.
- Detect multiple instances.
