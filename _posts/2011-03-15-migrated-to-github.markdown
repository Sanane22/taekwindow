title: Migrated to GitHub

The Taekwindow source code repository has been converted from Subversion to Git, and all development will take place through Git from now on. The project was also moved away from SourceForge and onto GitHub.

And while I was at it, I registered the domain `taekwindow.net` and redirected it to GitHub Pages. The website [taekwindow.net](http://taekwindow.net/) is now the one and only official Taekwindow site.

This also means that the news feed has moved. The news, previously from an RSS feed by SourceForge, is now supplied by an Atom feed via [http://taekwindow.net/atom.xml](http://taekwindow.net/atom.xml). If you want to stay up to date, be sure to let your feed reader know!
