- declare hook procedures with CALLBACK instead of __stdcall
- rename hooks.hpp to exports.hpp or something (?)
- better error handling (show message)
- integrate this info somewhere:

WH_CALLWNDPROC and WH_CALLWNDPROCRET can monitor messages but not modify them.

WH_GETMESSAGE can examine and modify messages, but only those from GetMessage or PeekMessage (i.e. posted messages).

WH_MOUSE and WH_KEYBOARD can monitor messages but not modify them; they run in the thread of the application that receives the message.

WH_MOUSE_LL and WH_KEYBOARD_LL can examine, modify and eat messages; they run in the thread of the application that installed the hook (!).
