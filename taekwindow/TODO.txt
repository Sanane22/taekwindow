TODO
----

- Eliminate dependency on CRT. Shaves off some bytes, and WinAPI functions can do pretty much the same things.
- Make it build with and without UNICODE by replacing L"" by _T(""); remove needless L"" items from version.h.
- Eliminate the /Wp64 warning.
- Set warning level to maximum and treat warnings as errors.
- Fix icon to look nice on Windows 7 taskbar; provide 20x20 and 24x24 icons for the tray.
