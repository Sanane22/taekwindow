TODO
----

- Eliminate dependency on CRT. Shaves off some bytes, and WinAPI functions can do pretty much the same things.
- Make it build with and without UNICODE by replacing L"" by _T("").
- Eliminate the /Wp64 warning.
- Set warning level to maximum and treat warnings as errors.
- Fix icon to look nice on Windows 7 taskbar.
