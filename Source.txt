The project and solution files were made in Microsoft Visual Studio 2005.

To build, you need the following in your PATH:
[Visual Studio directory]\VC\bin
[Visual Studio directory]\Common7\IDE

The project files may open in the Express editions of Visual C++ and Visual C#,
but I am not sure of this and have not tested it.

Internals
---------

There are several ways to do what Taekwindow does, among them: hooks and window subclassing.

- WH_CALLWNDPROC and WH_CALLWNDPROCRET can monitor messages but not modify them.
- WH_GETMESSAGE can examine and modify messages, but only those from GetMessage or PeekMessage (i.e. posted messages).
- WH_MOUSE and WH_KEYBOARD can monitor messages but not modify them; they run in the thread of the application that receives the message.
- WH_MOUSE_LL and WH_KEYBOARD_LL can examine, modify and eat messages; they run in the thread of the application that installed the hook (!).
- Window subclassing is tricky, needs to be done on all running applications, and requires that we inject ourselves into all threads somehow.

We currently use the WH_MOUSE and WH_KEYBOARD hooks, but in the future the _LL variants may come in useful as well, to eat key presses we don't want the application to see.
